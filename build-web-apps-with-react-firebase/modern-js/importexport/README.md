1. Modern JS features in ES6
2. export certain values from a file and import to another file
3. very handy & valuable in terms of components & modules
4. lookout for [ninja.js](./ninja.js)
5. lookout for [importexport-example.js](./importexport-example.js)
6. [index.html](index.html) -- `right click and run in Live server mode`
7. defauly export, while importing we can name it anything we want. Look [ninja.js](./ninja.js) defauly export and look [importexport-example.js](./importexport-example.js), how its ben imported with `abc`
8. Can only have one default export hence can be named anything while importing
